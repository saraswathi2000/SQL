   In the case of ROW_NUMBER(), we have a sequential number. 
   On the other hand, in the case of RANK(), we have the same rank for rows with the same value.
But there is a problem here. Although rows with the same value are assigned the same rank, the subsequent rank skips the missing rank. 
This wouldn’t give us the desired results if we had to return “top N distinct” values from a table. 
Therefore we have a different function to resolve this issue. */
